# Weather-App

In this project, a Weather App is created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The weather data is pulled from API from the OpenWeatherMap. I used the Built-in API request by city name from the site.

This Weather App will display the weather information like Temperature,  Weather condition, Humidity and Wind Speed according to the city. There is also a search box where user can enter the city name and get the weather information of the particular city.
